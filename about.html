      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        What started as a small family-run organic stall at a Johannesburg farmer’s market 
        has now grown into a trusted nationwide brand. Over the years, we’ve built strong 
        relationships with both our farmers and customers, ensuring that every product we 
        deliver is fresh, ethical, and full of goodness.
